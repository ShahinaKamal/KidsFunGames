        <p>To keep a good memory, it is important to make it work daily through a variety of activities.

            Indeed, it has been proved that the memory must work regularly and in various ways, in order to maintain a good level. It is therefore essential for everyone to regularly stimulate his memory in everyday life. You can set up small daily and simple exercises such as :
            
            <li>memorizing your shopping list,</li>
            <li>remembering the phone numbers of your loved ones,</li>
            <li>remembering the first names of your friend's children, or the name of your favorite actors or singers</li>
            <li>remembering the film you saw the day before on television...</li>
            
            There are also some very good board games wich will make your memory work, like Scrabble for example, or games that are played solo such as Sudoku, Puzzles, Crosswords and, of course, Memozor is also there to help you keep your memory in top form :)
            
            
            All our games are there to allow you to have a fun time. Furthermore, regularly playing various games that stimulate your memory allows you to maintain it in a fun way.
            
            
            And finally, do not forget that to take good care of your memory, you should never neglect your sleep neither your diet, and it is recommended to favor social relationships with those around you because these play an important role in maintaining good memory.</p>
